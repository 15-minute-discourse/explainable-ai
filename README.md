Explainable AI: Privacy, Evaluation, and Human Interaction

The Tension Between Explainability and Data Privacy

The pursuit of explainability in AI systems often clashes with data privacy, especially under regulations like GDPR. XAI, by its nature, seeks to reveal the inner workings of an AI model, and this transparency can inadvertently expose sensitive personal information embedded in the training data \[1-3\]. For instance, if an AI model is trained on medical records to predict disease risk, the explanations it provides could disclose an individual's health conditions \[2\].

Several strategies can be employed to navigate this tension:

● Differential Privacy: This technique adds carefully calibrated noise to the data or model outputs \[1, 4\]. While preserving aggregate analysis and explanations, it obscures individual data points, safeguarding privacy.

● Selective Explanation Disclosure: This approach involves tailoring the level of detail in explanations based on the sensitivity of the information and the audience \[5\]. For instance, system developers might receive comprehensive explanations, whereas end-users receive more generalized interpretations.

● Data Sanitization: This method involves preprocessing the training data to remove or anonymize personally identifiable information before feeding it to the AI model \[6\]. By minimizing sensitive information in the model itself, the risk of exposure through explanations is reduced.

The Challenge of Evaluating Explanations

Determining whether an explanation is "good" is a complex challenge in XAI. The lack of a universally accepted definition of a "good" explanation and the absence of standardized metrics makes evaluating and comparing different XAI methods difficult \[7, 8\].

A major hurdle lies in the limitations of using "ground-truth" explanations, as even human annotators may struggle to understand the intricate workings of black-box models and define definitive connections between inputs and outputs \[7\]. This ambiguity makes it challenging to develop automatic metrics for comparing models and assessing their alignment with human annotations.

Further research is needed to develop robust evaluation frameworks and metrics that capture the multifaceted nature of explanation quality, encompassing aspects like accuracy, fidelity, stability, and comprehensibility.

The Role of Human-Computer Interaction in XAI

The effectiveness of XAI hinges on the design of systems that are intuitive and comprehensible to humans \[9\]. Interactive explanations, allowing users to probe various aspects of the model and pose follow-up questions, can significantly enhance user understanding and trust \[10-12\].

To achieve this, XAI systems need to incorporate principles of human-computer interaction (HCI):

● User-Centric Explanation Design: Explanations should be tailored to the specific needs and understanding of the intended audience, avoiding overly technical jargon and employing clear, concise language \[13-15\]. Visualizations and interactive elements can aid in making complex information more accessible \[16, 17\].

● Interactive Explanations: Users should be empowered to engage with explanations actively \[9, 18\]. This could involve drill-down functionalities to explore underlying factors, the ability to toggle between different levels of detail, and the option to compare alternative models or decision-making processes \[17\].

● Belief Change Theory: Formal frameworks from belief change theory can be utilized to model how users integrate new information gleaned from explanations \[10, 19\]. This understanding can guide the design of interfaces that support interactive exploration and learning, fostering trust and confidence in the AI system.

Explainable AI: Challenges, Potential, and Limitations

The Challenge of Explaining Deep Learning Models

Deep learning models, renowned for their complexity and opacity, present a significant challenge for XAI. These models often involve intricate layers and non-linear relationships, making it difficult to understand the decision-making process \[1-3\]. This lack of transparency, referred to as the "black box" problem, has hindered the widespread adoption of deep learning in high-stakes fields such as healthcare and finance \[2, 4-8\].

Several promising approaches are being explored to develop XAI methods capable of explaining these complex models:

● Capturing Causal Dependencies: Future XAI methods are expected to delve deeper into understanding and explaining the causal relationships within deep learning models \[9\]. This involves moving beyond mere correlations to uncover the true cause-and-effect relationships driving predictions \[10\]. For example, counterfactual explanations can illustrate how changing specific inputs would alter the model's output, providing insights into the causal factors influencing decisions \[11, 12\].

● Human-in-the-loop Approaches: Integrating human expertise and feedback into the XAI process is crucial for bridging the gap in conceptual understanding \[9\]. This involves designing interactive interfaces that allow domain experts to pose questions, explore counterfactual scenarios, and provide feedback to refine explanations \[9, 13\]. Such collaborative approaches can leverage human intuition and domain knowledge to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models.

● Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP): LRP is a technique that identifies which features in the input data contribute most strongly to a neural network's output \[14\]. By analyzing the relevance of each feature at different layers of the network, LRP can provide a more granular understanding of how the model arrives at its predictions.

The Potential for XAI to Improve Human Decision-Making

XAI has the potential to enhance human decision-making not only by explaining AI systems but also by providing insights into our own reasoning processes. By acting as a mirror, XAI can help us identify our own biases, blind spots, and inconsistencies in decision-making. This can lead to more informed, rational, and ethical choices.

Here's how XAI can be used as a tool for reflection and learning:

● Revealing Hidden Biases: XAI methods can uncover biases in both AI systems and human decision-making. By comparing AI-generated explanations with human justifications for similar decisions, we can identify potential biases we might not be consciously aware of. This awareness can then prompt us to examine our assumptions and strive for more objective and equitable decision-making.

● Facilitating Critical Thinking: XAI explanations can challenge our understanding of a problem and encourage deeper reflection. When presented with a clear and concise explanation of how an AI system reached a particular conclusion, we can evaluate its logic, identify potential flaws, and consider alternative perspectives. This process can sharpen our critical thinking skills and improve the quality of our own decisions.

● Promoting Learning and Improvement: By analyzing AI-generated explanations, we can learn from the model's reasoning process and potentially improve our own decision-making strategies. For instance, we might discover new relationships between variables or identify previously overlooked factors that influence outcomes. This iterative learning process can lead to more sophisticated and effective decision-making.

The Limitations of XAI

While XAI is a powerful tool for enhancing transparency and trust in AI, it's essential to acknowledge its limitations \[15, 16\]. Explainability is not a silver bullet, and several factors can constrain the effectiveness of XAI:

● Inherent Complexity of Some AI Systems: Some AI models, particularly deep learning models, are inherently complex and may have decision-making processes that are difficult to fully explain \[17\]. The intricate interactions between numerous parameters and non-linear transformations can make it challenging to provide comprehensive and easily understandable explanations.

● Trade-off Between Accuracy and Interpretability: There is often a tension between model accuracy and interpretability \[4, 18-21\]. Simpler, more interpretable models may sacrifice some accuracy for transparency, while highly accurate models may be more opaque and difficult to explain. Finding the right balance between these two factors is crucial and depends on the specific application and its requirements.

● Subjectivity of Explanations: The effectiveness of an explanation depends on the user's background knowledge and understanding of the AI system \[15, 22\]. What is considered a clear and sufficient explanation for one user might be confusing or inadequate for another. Tailoring explanations to different audiences and providing multiple levels of detail can help address this challenge.

● Potential for Misinterpretation: Even well-intentioned explanations can be misinterpreted or misused, particularly if they are presented without proper context or qualifications. It's crucial to provide clear disclaimers and avoid oversimplifying complex concepts to minimize the risk of misunderstandings.

Managing expectations and fostering a nuanced understanding of XAI's capabilities is essential. Transparency and explainability are ongoing endeavors, and there will always be aspects of AI systems that remain challenging to fully explain. However, by acknowledging these limitations and promoting responsible development and deployment practices, we can leverage XAI to build more trustworthy and beneficial AI systems.

Explainable AI for Evaluating Machine Unlearning

Explainable AI (XAI) can be used to verify the effectiveness of machine unlearning (MU) techniques by visualizing and quantifying changes in the model's focus after the unlearning process \[1-3\]. This is particularly relevant in situations where models need to "forget" specific data or patterns, such as in compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR \[1, 2\].

Attribution-based XAI methods are particularly useful for this purpose \[1, 3\]. They work by assigning importance scores to different input features, highlighting which features the model relies on for making predictions. By comparing the attribution maps before and after applying MU, researchers can assess whether the unlearning process successfully reduced the model's reliance on the targeted features.

One study explored using attribution-based XAI to evaluate MU in the context of harbor front monitoring \[1, 2\]. The task was to count objects of interest while ensuring the model "unlearns" the ability to count humans, addressing potential privacy concerns. They utilized the Similarity Difference and Uniqueness (SIDU) method, which generates heatmaps showing the importance of different image regions \[4\].

Here's how they applied XAI to evaluate unlearning:

● Baseline Models: They trained models on the original data and data where human counts were removed. These models served as baselines for comparison.

● MU Techniques: They applied various MU techniques, including data relabeling, model perturbation, and combinations of these, to the original model.

● Heatmap Comparison: They generated SIDU heatmaps for the baseline models and the models that underwent MU. The goal was to visually and quantitatively assess the shift in feature importance.

The study highlighted several insights:

● Qualitative Verification: Visual comparison of the heatmaps showed a clear reduction in the model's focus on human features after applying certain MU methods \[5\]. This qualitative assessment provided direct evidence of the unlearning process's effectiveness.

● Quantitative Metrics: They introduced novel metrics, Heatmap Coverage (HC) and Attention Shift (AS), to quantify the changes observed in the heatmaps \[3\]. HC measures the spatial correctness of the heatmaps, while AS quantifies the shift in attention to relevant areas. These metrics provided a more objective way to assess unlearning.

● Performance Comparison: While standard metrics like RMSE and MAE didn't show significant differences between retrained and unlearned models, XAI revealed that MU methods could lead to a better focus on the remaining objects of interest \[6\]. This finding suggests that MU can be a more efficient alternative to complete retraining in certain scenarios.

Overall, the study demonstrated that attribution-based XAI methods, like SIDU, can be valuable tools for evaluating the effectiveness of MU. By visualizing and quantifying the shift in feature importance, XAI provides a more comprehensive understanding of the unlearning process beyond traditional performance metrics. This approach helps ensure that models effectively "forget" unwanted information while maintaining their ability to make accurate predictions on the remaining data.

Prototype-Based Explainable AI

Prototype-based methods in XAI are inherently interpretable methods that make predictions and generate explanations by comparing input data to a set of learned prototypes. These prototypes represent typical examples or patterns within each class of the training data. The comparison between input data and prototypes provides insights into the model's decision-making process, making it easier to understand why a certain prediction was made. \[1, 2\]

Key Concepts in Prototype-Based XAI

● Prototypes: Learned representations that capture essential characteristics of different classes in the data. \[1\]

● Similarity Metric: A function used to calculate the distance or similarity between an input data point and the prototypes. The prediction is typically based on the prototype with the highest similarity to the input. \[3\]

● Case-Based Reasoning: The process of using similarities between the input data and prototypes to explain the prediction, mimicking how humans often reason by comparing new instances to familiar examples. \[2\]

Applications in Different Learning Tasks

Prototype-based XAI methods can be applied to a variety of learning tasks, including:

● Image Classification: Prototypes can represent key visual features of different object categories. \[4\] For instance, in a model trained to classify birds, prototypes might represent characteristic beak shapes, wing patterns, or overall bird silhouettes.

● Sequential Data Analysis: Prototypes can represent common sequences of events or patterns in time-series data. \[5\] For example, in a model analyzing stock market data, prototypes might represent typical patterns of price fluctuations.

● Anomaly Detection: Prototypes learned from "normal" data can be used to identify anomalies by detecting instances that significantly deviate from these prototypes. \[6\]

● Multi-Modal Data Analysis: Prototype-based methods can be extended to handle data from multiple sources, such as images and text, by learning prototypes that capture the relationships between these modalities. \[7\]

Advantages of Prototype-Based Methods

● Inherent Interpretability: Explanations are directly derived from the model's decision-making process, as opposed to post-hoc methods that try to interpret the model after it's already been trained. \[8\]

● Human-Understandable Explanations: Prototypes provide concrete, visualizable examples that can be easily understood, even by non-experts. \[2\]

● Flexibility and Adaptability: Prototype-based methods can be adapted to different data types and learning tasks, including those involving complex relationships between features. \[9, 10\]

Examples of Prototype-Based XAI Methods

● ProtoPNet: Learns prototypes that represent patches or parts of images, providing more localized explanations for image classification. \[11\]

● ProtoTree: Combines prototypes with decision trees, allowing for hierarchical reasoning and more complex decision boundaries. \[12\]

● NP-ProtoPNet: Extends ProtoPNet with negative reasoning, enabling the model to reject classes based on the absence of certain prototypical patterns. \[13\]

Considerations for Geoscientific Data

Geoscientific data often exhibit unique characteristics, such as temporal and spatial dependencies, high dimensionality, and multi-modality. When applying prototype-based methods to such data, it's important to consider these factors and adapt the methods accordingly. \[10, 14, 15\]

Overall, prototype-based XAI methods offer a promising approach to enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of machine learning models. By providing human-understandable explanations based on concrete examples, these methods can facilitate better understanding, trust, and collaboration between humans and AI systems.

Formalizing Explainable AI Problems

Defining XAI problems formally is crucial for creating effective and trustworthy Explainable AI (XAI) systems. Without a clear problem definition, it becomes challenging to evaluate and compare different XAI methods objectively \[1\].

Current Limitations and the Need for Formalization

The current state of XAI faces several limitations that hinder its ability to serve as a reliable tool for quality assurance in machine learning \[1\]:

● Ambiguous Terminology: The term "explanation" is used loosely in various contexts, leading to confusion and difficulty in establishing consistent evaluation frameworks.

● Algorithm-Driven Development: Many XAI methods are developed based solely on algorithms without a clear connection to a formally defined problem. This approach results in methods defining the problems they solve, creating a circular and less meaningful evaluation process \[2\].

● Lack of Objective Evaluation Criteria: XAI often lacks well-defined, objective criteria for evaluating explanation correctness. Existing theoretical frameworks and axioms, while helpful as sanity checks, do not offer concrete measures of correctness or utility for specific purposes \[3\].

● Reliance on Human Judgment: While human judgment can be helpful in evaluating XAI, it's inherently subjective and susceptible to biases, making it an insufficient basis for rigorous validation \[4\].

Steps Towards Formalizing XAI Problems

To overcome these limitations, researchers propose a shift in the XAI development process \[5\]:

1.

Identify User and Stakeholder Needs: Determine the specific information needs of the intended users and stakeholders for a given use case. For example, medical professionals might require different explanations compared to patients. \[5, 6\]

2.

Formally Define XAI Problems: Based on the identified information needs, formally define the problems that XAI aims to address. This involves specifying the types of questions the explanations should answer, the intended use of the explanations, and the assumptions under which the explanations are valid. \[1, 5, 6\]

3.

Design Methods for Specific Problems: Develop tailored XAI methods to solve these well-defined problems. These methods should be grounded in a clear understanding of the problem's requirements and constraints. \[5\]

4.

Perform Theoretical Analysis: Conduct theoretical analyses to assess whether the proposed methods satisfy the formally defined requirements and address the identified information needs. \[5, 7\]

5.

Empirical Validation: Utilize appropriate benchmarks and ground-truth data to validate the effectiveness and correctness of the XAI methods empirically. Synthetic datasets with known ground-truth explanations can play a vital role in this validation process. \[5, 8\]

6.

Continuous Improvement: Iteratively refine the methods based on feedback from both theoretical analysis and empirical validation to ensure that they continue to meet the evolving needs of users and stakeholders. \[5\]

By following these steps, researchers can move towards a more rigorous and standardized approach to developing and evaluating XAI. This will lead to the creation of XAI systems that are not only explainable but also demonstrably correct and trustworthy for critical applications.

Ground-Truth Benchmark Datasets for Explainable AI

Ground-truth benchmark datasets are crucial for objectively evaluating the performance of XAI methods. These datasets are specifically designed so that the features that genuinely contribute to the prediction target are known beforehand. This knowledge allows for a direct comparison between the explanations generated by XAI methods and the true underlying relationships in the data.

Here are some key considerations and techniques used in designing ground-truth benchmark datasets for XAI evaluation:

● Synthetic Data Generation: Synthetic datasets are created using known and controlled parametric distributions, ensuring that the relationship between features and the prediction target is clearly defined. This approach allows for the introduction of specific types of relationships, including linear, non-linear, and those involving suppressor variables, to assess how different XAI methods perform under varying conditions \[1, 2\].

● Incorporating Suppressor Variables: Suppressor variables are features that don't have a direct statistical association with the target but influence the relationship between other features and the target. Including suppressor variables in benchmark datasets helps evaluate an XAI method's ability to identify features that indirectly contribute to the prediction \[1, 3, 4\].

● Multi-Modality Datasets: Benchmark datasets encompassing various input modalities, like images, text, and tabular data, are essential for assessing the generalizability of XAI methods across different data types. This allows researchers to understand whether methods designed for one modality, like images, perform equally well on other modalities, like text \[5-7\].

● Controlled Feature Manipulation: Datasets can be designed where specific features are manipulated to be either relevant or irrelevant to the prediction target. This controlled manipulation allows for a precise evaluation of whether XAI methods correctly attribute importance to the manipulated features \[2, 8\].

● Real Data with Synthetic Ground Truth: A hybrid approach combines real-world data with synthetically generated ground-truth explanations. For instance, real images can be used, and synthetic features, like strategically placed lesions, can be added to create a ground truth for medical image classification tasks \[2\].

● Human-Annotated Ground Truth: While human annotation can be subjective, it's valuable for tasks where defining a clear ground truth programmatically is challenging. For example, in image classification, humans can annotate regions of interest that are relevant for a particular prediction, providing a basis for comparison with XAI-generated explanations \[7, 9, 10\].

By using these techniques, researchers can develop ground-truth benchmark datasets that enable a robust and objective evaluation of XAI methods. This leads to a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different methods, fostering the development of more reliable and trustworthy XAI techniques for various applications \[2, 5, 11, 12\].

Explainable Question Answering Systems

Explainable Question Answering Systems (EQUAS) aim to answer user questions about multimedia data and provide explanations for their answers. Here are some specific examples of EQUAS components, drawing on the provided sources:

● EQUAS for Images and Video: EQUAS can be applied to both image and video data to answer questions related to their content \[1\]. For example, an EQUAS for video could explain why it identified a particular action in a video clip.

● Semantic Labeling of DNN Neurons: This involves associating specific neurons in a deep neural network (DNN) with meaningful concepts \[1, 2\]. For example, a neuron might be labeled as a "wheel detector" if it consistently activates when a wheel is present in an image. This labeling helps translate neural activations into understandable explanations.

● DNN Audit Trail Construction: This involves tracking the activation patterns of neurons within a DNN during the question-answering process \[1\]. This audit trail provides a step-by-step record of how the DNN arrived at its answer, making it easier to understand the reasoning behind the decision.

● Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM): This technique visually highlights the regions of an image that were most influential for the DNN's prediction \[1, 2\]. It helps users understand which parts of the image the DNN focused on to arrive at its answer.

● Comprehensive Strategy Based on Argumentation Theory: This approach uses principles of argumentation to construct explanations \[1, 2\]. This involves identifying different arguments that support or attack a particular conclusion. For example, one argument may support a conclusion that a user will like a movie because they like the director, while another argument may attack this conclusion if the user has rated other movies in the same genre poorly. This approach makes it possible for a user to ask, “Why did you recommend this to me?” and receive a clear response.

By combining these techniques, EQUAS can provide users with comprehensive and understandable explanations for the answers generated by AI systems. This promotes trust and transparency in AI-driven question-answering applications.

Explainable AI through Argumentation Theory

Argumentation theory can make AI more explainable by representing data as a framework of arguments that support or attack one another. This approach allows users to engage in a "dialectical and dialogical" process with the AI system \[1, 2\].

For example, in a movie recommendation system, one argument might support recommending a particular movie because the user likes the director, while another argument might attack this suggestion based on the user's low ratings for other movies in the same genre. This argumentation framework enables the system to provide clear and understandable explanations for its recommendations when a user asks, "Why did you recommend this to me?" \[1\].

The benefits of using argumentation theory for explainable AI extend beyond providing rationales for recommendations. Here's how it further enhances explainability:

● Interactive Feedback and Improvement: Users can provide feedback by indicating whether they agree or disagree with specific arguments presented by the system. For example, a user could say, "I don't care about directors – that's not important to me." This feedback allows the system to adjust the weight of different arguments in its decision-making process, leading to iteratively better recommendations over time \[3\].

● Transparency and Trust: By making the reasoning process transparent and allowing users to understand the basis for recommendations, argumentation-based AI systems foster greater trust and encourage continued use \[1\]. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes applications where users need to have confidence in the system's decisions.

● Contestability and User Control: Argumentation theory allows users to challenge the AI's reasoning and engage in a dialogue to refine the system's understanding of their preferences. This interactivity aligns with the principles of contestable AI, where users have a degree of control over the system's behavior \[4\].

In essence, argumentation theory provides a framework for building AI systems that can reason, explain, and engage in a dialogue with users, making the decision-making process more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy.

Explainable AI in Construction

Explainable AI (XAI) can play a crucial role in the construction industry by providing transparency and insights into AI models used for various tasks. One of the primary benefits of XAI is its ability to explain the data used to train a model. This explanation can encompass:

● What data was used and why it was chosen. This includes providing information about the data sources, the rationale behind the data selection process, and any potential limitations of the data. \[1, 2\]

● How fairness was assessed in the data. This involves examining the data for potential biases related to factors such as demographics, location, or project types. \[2\]

● What efforts were made to mitigate bias in the data. This could involve techniques like data balancing, re-weighting, or using fairness-aware algorithms during the data preparation and model training phases. \[2\]

Beyond data explainability, XAI can also shed light on the inner workings of AI models used in construction, addressing questions such as:

● What model features were activated and how they contributed to a specific output. This involves identifying which input features (e.g., material costs, labor availability, weather conditions) had the most significant influence on the model's prediction (e.g., project duration, cost estimation). \[2\]

○ For example, a feature-importance explanation can answer "why" questions about a model's output. \[3\]

● What are the individual layers that make up the model, and how do they contribute to the final output? This involves explaining the architecture of the model, particularly if it's a complex model like a deep neural network. By understanding the role of each layer and how information flows through the model, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of the decision-making process. \[2\]

By providing clear explanations for both the data and the model, XAI can help build trust and confidence in AI-driven systems within the construction industry. This is especially important given the potential impact of AI on project outcomes, safety, and overall efficiency in construction. \[4\]

Here are some specific examples of how XAI can be used in construction:

● Explaining cost overruns: An XAI model could identify the specific factors that led to a project exceeding its budget, helping project managers understand the root causes and make more informed decisions in the future.

● Predicting safety hazards: An XAI model trained to predict safety risks on a construction site could highlight the specific features (e.g., unsafe working conditions, lack of proper equipment) that contribute to the risk assessment, enabling proactive safety measures.

● Optimizing resource allocation: An XAI model used for resource allocation could explain why certain resources are being allocated in a particular way, helping ensure fairness and efficiency in resource distribution.

Overall, XAI has the potential to make AI systems in construction more transparent, accountable, and reliable, leading to better decision-making, improved safety, and increased trust among all stakeholders.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging area of research in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) \[1\].

What is Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)?

XAI is a system that can explain its behavior to a human user \[2\]. More specifically, XAI systems should be able to explain their capabilities, "what it has done, what it is doing, and what will happen" and then reveal the relevant information they are acting on \[3\].

● XAI can explain how AI obtained a particular solution (e.g., classification or object detection) and can also answer other "wh" questions \[1\].

● XAI can help explain why and how the output of deep learning and machine learning models are generated, reducing bias and error, and improving confidence in decision-making \[4\].

● XAI systems explain their past actions, ongoing processes and upcoming steps, and disclose the relevant information on which its actions are based \[5\].

Why is XAI Needed?

We are entering a new age of AI applications, and machine learning is the core technology \[6\]. However, current AI is mainly limited to machine learning, which is like a black box. It can answer simple questions but cannot explain how it arrived at the answer \[7\]. As a result, the decisions and actions of machine learning models are difficult for people to understand \[2, 6\].

Explainability is essential for critical applications, such as defense, healthcare, law and order, and autonomous driving vehicles, where the know-how is required for trust and transparency \[1\]. XAI is essential if users are to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage these artificially intelligent partners \[2\].

Concepts Related to XAI

The concepts of transparency, interpretability and explainability in the context of AI have no formal definition, and are sometimes used interchangeably \[5, 8\]. Here are some definitions for these concepts:

● Transparency: Refers to the ability for a specific model to be understood. In the case of inherently transparent models, such as decision trees, the model itself provides the explanation, and no additional techniques are needed to understand how a given input leads to a certain output \[5\].

● Interpretability: The degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. This often involves simplifying complex model predictions into human-comprehensible insights \[9\].

● Explainability: The extent to which the internal mechanics of a machine learning model can be understood. Explainability goes a step further than interpretability by focusing on 'why' a decision was made \[10\].

Explainability is a Social Construct

● Explanations are a transfer of knowledge, presented as part of a conversation or interaction \[11\].

● Explanations are influenced by individual vs. group behavior, norms and morals, etc. \[11\].

When providing explainability, it is essential to consider the human aspect, as explanations must be relevant and meaningful to people \[11, 12\]. Human beings perceive and process information in different ways based on:

● Preferences for contrastive explanations \[12\]

● Selectiveness \[12\]

● Trust in the explanations \[12\]

● Ability to contextualize explanations \[12\]

Types of Explainability

Explainability methods are specifically designed to unveil the decision-making processes of complex, opaque models, often referred to as black boxes \[13\].

● Post-hoc explainability involves creating explanations after the model has already made a decision \[1, 14, 15\]. Post-hoc methods may be preferred for situations where a more detailed or complex explanation is needed after a decision has been made. Post-hoc methods for explainability make the model more interpretable \[14\]. These methods focus on explaining the reasoning behind individual predictions, rather than providing insights into the overall workings of the model \[16\].

● Transparent ML models are interpretable to an extent by themselves only \[14\]. These models have inherent interpretability built into their structure, making it easier to understand their decision-making process. Transparent models may be preferred when speed and simplicity are important factors, as they do not require additional computation for generating explanations \[16\].

Approaches to Computing Explanations

There are two main approaches to computing explanations:

● Heuristic approaches are the majority \[17\].

● Abductive reasoning can be used to compute provably correct explanations for machine learning (ML) predictions \[17\]. This rigorous approach has been shown to be useful for computing trustable explanations, validating explanations computed heuristically, and uncovering a close relationship between XAI and verification of ML models \[17\].

Stakeholders in XAI

Explainable AI (XAI) targets diverse entities and includes various stakeholders, such as researchers, model developers like engineers and data scientists, as well as practitioners \[18\].

Levels of Explainability

There are different levels of explanations possible with XAI, which can be described as "orders of explanation" \[19\]:

● Zero-order explanations provide very basic information about the model's output, such as identifying which features were most important in making a prediction \[20, 21\]. Zero-order explanations are not very comprehensive and may not be enough to create trust and acceptance in the AI system \[20\].

● Higher-order explanations go beyond simply identifying important features and try to provide a more causal understanding of why the model made a particular decision \[19, 21\]. They utilize an agent's objectives or dispositions to provide more information \[20\]. An example of a higher-order explanation would be a statement like "The agent decided to produce more products because the buffer level was low, and the agent is punished if the buffer content is too low" \[22\]. Higher-order explanations can be achieved by combining domain knowledge with the reward function of the AI agent \[21\]. These types of explanations are more likely to be trusted and accepted by users \[19\].

Challenges in XAI

● Lack of a universally accepted definition of explainability \[3, 23\]. There is no consensus on what constitutes XAI \[3\]. Because there is no common definition of XAI, it can be difficult to measure the quality of explanations \[23\].

● Balancing accuracy and interpretability: It can be challenging to develop models that are both accurate and easy to understand. Often, there is a trade-off between these two goals \[24, 25\]. More complex models may achieve higher accuracy but be more difficult to interpret \[25\].

● Subjectivity in interpretation: What constitutes a good explanation can vary depending on the individual user and the specific context \[26\]. Different users may have different levels of understanding of AI, and they may require different types of explanations to feel comfortable with the system \[27\]. A single decision or recommendation might therefore need to be explained in multiple ways, reflecting the needs of different audiences and the issues at play in different situations \[27\].

● Misleading explanations: It is possible to generate explanations that are plausible-sounding but do not accurately reflect the model's decision-making process \[28, 29\]. This can lead users to trust a system that is not actually performing well \[28\].

● Explainability can have downsides: Sometimes it may be better to have a more accurate but less explainable AI system than a less accurate but more explainable system \[30\]. For example, in some cases, providing an explanation could give away valuable intellectual property \[31\].

XAI Evaluation and Future Directions

There are various metrics for evaluating explainability, such as Fidelity, Stability and Consistency, Comprehensibility, Local Accuracy, Representativeness, and Faithfulness \[32\]. These metrics help assess how well explanations align with the model's true behavior and how easily they can be interpreted by users \[32\].

To ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of XAI, future research should focus on:

● Developing formal notions of explanation correctness \[33\].

● Evaluating XAI methods against objective criteria \[33\].

● Creating objective metrics of explanation performance that can be assessed using ground-truth data \[33\].

● Engaging stakeholders in the development and evaluation of XAI methods \[30\].

Conclusion

The development of XAI is critical for ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically \[18\]. XAI can help to build trust in AI systems, improve their accuracy and fairness, and make them more understandable to human users \[25\]. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before XAI can be widely adopted \[25\].
